An actor framework for Dart

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/Vizidrix/jester/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/Vizidrix/deny/latest)

[See documentation for examples and guide](https://github.com/Vizidrix/jester/tree/master/doc/getting_started.md)


Goals:
- Provide an abstraction over isolates to enable simple Aggregate Root capabilities
- Allow mutable behavior semantics
- Consistent definitions for Commands and Events
- Customize operators to keep interactions terse
- Consider performance, messaging between actors will play a core role in apps that use this model
